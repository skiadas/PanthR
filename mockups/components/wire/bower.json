Consequently, your components will be more\nmodular, easier to unit test and refactor, and your application will be\neasier to evolve and maintain.\n\nTo find out more, read the [full introduction](docs/introduction.md),\nmore about the [concepts behind wire](docs/concepts.md),\nand check out a few [example applications](docs/introduction.md#example-apps).\n\n# Documentation\n\n1. [Getting Started](docs/get.md)\n1. [Reference Documentation](docs/README.md)\n1. [Example Code and Apps](docs/introduction.md#example-apps)\n\n# What's new\n\n### 0.10.0\n\n* Support for creating and managing [jQuery UI Widgets](docs/jquery.md#jquery-ui-widgets) (much like the existing Dijit widget support).\n* More compact syntax for including plugins: just [include the module id](docs/plugins.md#using-plugins) as a string! The [object syntax](docs/plugins.md#plugin-options) is still supported as well.\n* New [docs for using and creating](docs/plugins.md) wire plugins.\n* Many other [documentation](docs) additions and improvements.\n* [New APIs available to plugins](docs/plugins.md#plugin-api) for monitoring the overall state of wiring, inserting components into the current context, and more.\n* Many internal improvements:\n\t* Reduced overall memory usage\n\t* Improved wiring performance\n\t* Preparing for a bunch of new awesomeness in upcoming releases\n* Compatibility with when.js 1.5.0 - 2.x.\n\t* **NOTE:** wire 0.10.x is the last set of releases that will be compatible with when < 2.0.\n\n### 0.9.4\n\n* Fix for [render factory](docs/dom.md#rendering-dom-elements) in IE8.\n\n### 0.9.3\n\n* Compatibility with when.js 1.5.0 - 2.0.x.  If you use when >= 2.0.0, you *MUST* update to wire 0.9.3.  There are no other changes in 0.9.3.\n\n### 0.9.2\n\n* IE-specific fix for `wire/debug`'s `trace` option.  See [#78](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/issues/78)\n\n### 0.9.1\n\n* Fix for compose factory. See [#69](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/issues/69)\n\n### 0.9.0\n\n* [Get it!](docs/get.md)\n* [All new documentation](docs/README.md)\n* [Even more DOM support](docs/dom.md), including DOM event connections via wire/on and cloning DOM elements.\n* [Functions are first-class citizens](docs/functions.md) that can be used in very powerful ways.\n* [Transform connections](docs/connections.md#transform-connections) use functions to transform data as it flows through connections (including DOM event connections).\n* Built on latest [cujo.js](http://cujojs.com) platform:\n\t* [curl](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) >= 0.7.1, or 0.6.8\n\t* [when](https://github.com/cujojs/when) >= 1.5.0\n\t* [meld](https://github.com/cujojs/meld) >= 1.0.0\n\t* [poly](https://github.com/cujojs/poly) >= 0.5.0\n\n[Full Changelog](CHANGES.md)\n\n# License\n\nwire.js is licensed under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n",
